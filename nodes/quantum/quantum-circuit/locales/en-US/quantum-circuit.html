    This node initialises a quantum circuit. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To use this node, first select whether you wish to build a circuit with:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bits only</b> &#8594; qubits & classical bits</li>
      <li><b>Registers & Bits</b> &#8594; quantum & classical registers storing qubits and classical bits respectively</li>
    </ul>
    Registers are used to group bits with the same role together
    for circuit structuring purposes.
    <br /><br />
    Then, you must inform the number of:
    <ul>
      <li>Qubits & Classical bits in <b>Bits only</b> mode</li>
      <li>Quantum & Classical registers in <b>Registers</b> mode</li>
    </ul>
    This will define the number of outputs of the <i>Quantum Circuit</i> node. 
    <br/><br/>
    In fact, the node will generate and output:
    <ul>
      <li>Qubit objects in <b>Bits only</b> mode: to flow through the quantum gate nodes of the algorithm
      <li>Register objects in <b>Registers</b> mode: must be connected to <i>Quantum Register</i> & <i>Classical Register</i> nodes</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    By default, qubits are initialised in the '0 state'. <br/>
    To initialise the qubits in a specific state ('0' or '1'), you can pass a binary string in <code>msg.payload.binaryString</code> 
    to the <i>Quantum Circuit</i> node. The string must have a length equal to the total number of qubits in the circuit: 1 bit 
    initialises 1 qubit (e.g. '001101' for a 6 qubits circuit). <br />
    The first (visually higher) qubit will be set according to the first bit of the string, second higher qubit by the second bit, etc. 
    <br /><br />
    Classical bits, either in a register or as individual bits, are crucial in a quantum circuit to store the result of qubit measurements.

    <h5>Qubit State</h5>
    <p>
      A qubit is the same to a quantum computer than what a bit is to a classical computer: the smallest unit of information.
      <br /><br />
      <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html#statevectors"> Classical vs Quantum bits - Qiskit textbook</a>
      <br /><br />
      The <b>Bloch sphere</b> representation is considered as the most simple and ludic way to understand & visualise a qubit (see image below).
      <br /><br />
      In contrast with classical bits that can only be in a '0' or a '1' state, qubits can store much more information.
      In fact, all points on the sphere represent a different qubit state, the usual classical bit states being labelled as:
      <ul>
        <li>State 0</li>
        <li>State 1</li>
      </ul>
      Quantum states that are in between those 2 points are a weighted combination of the '0' and '1' states. This is called <b>superposition</b>. <br/>
      To set the qubit in a particular state, we operate rotations or reflections of the <b>Bloch sphere</b> while keeping the x, y and z axis unchanged.
      <br /><br />
      <b>Example:</b> Applying a &#960; radians rotation about the x-axis on a qubit that is in the '0 state' will put it in the '1 state'.

    <h5>Qubit Measurement</h5>
    <p>
      It is very important to understand that, even though a qubit can take an infinite number of states, our technology only allows us to measure '0' or '1', like on a classical bit.
      <br/><br/>
      Since we measure and interpret a qubit state using classical machines, this can be seen as a projection of quantum computing back to classical computing: from quantum states back to binary values.
      <br /><br />
      This leads to probabilistic measurement results.
      In terms of the <b>Bloch Sphere</b>, the closest the qubit state is from the '1 state', the more likely we are to measure a '1'.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Example:</b> If we measure a 1000 times a qubit that has a state in the x-y plane, then we will get more or less 500 '0' measurements and 500 '1' measurements. 
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Careful -</b> The act of measuring a qubit collapses the qubit state: the state of the qubit after being measured 
      is not representative of the qubit state before the measurement.<br/>
      Please measure the qubits at the end of the quantum circuit or reset them after a measurement.
      <br /><br />

    <h5>Entanglement</h5>
    <p>
      Referred to as a "spooky action at a distance" by Albert Einstein, <b>entanglement</b> is a quantum phenomenon that is extremely powerful in quantum computing. 
      It is a form of connection that can exist between any number of qubits. Here, we will illustrate <b>entanglement</b> between two qubits.
      <br /><br />
      Two qubits are said to be <b>entangled</b> when their relative states rely on each other. 
      In other words, changing or knowing the state of one qubit can change the state of the other qubit. 
      This connection is independent of time and space: the two qubits can be miles appart and the connection will still be instantaneous.
      <br /><br />
      In practice, <b>entanglement</b> arises when the operation of a gate on a qubit is conditional on the state of another qubit (similar to an <code>if</code> block in classical computing). 
      These gates are often referred to as 
      <a href="https://github.com/node-red-quantum/node-red-contrib-quantum/wiki/Quantum-Gate-Nodes/#multi-qubits-quantum-gates">multi-qubits quantum gates</a>.  
      <br /><br />
      <b>Example -</b> A CNOT gate applies a NOT gate (0 &#8594; 1 & 1 &#8594; 0) to the 'target' qubit <b>if and only if</b> the 'control' qubit is in the '1' state.
      <br /><br />
      Now, let's assume that the 'control' qubit is in a <b>superposition</b> state (25% '0' / 75% '1'), while the 'target' qubit is in the '0' state.<br />
      Then, the <b>combined</b> state of the 2 qubits after applying the CNOT gate will be:
      <ul>
          <li>'00' with 25% probability</li>
          <li>'11' with 75% probability</li>
      </ul>
      The 2 qubits are now <b>entangled</b>. If we measure one of them to be in the '1' state, then we know that other qubit will be in the '1' state as well.
      <br /><br />
