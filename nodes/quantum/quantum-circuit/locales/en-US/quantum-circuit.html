    This node initialises a quantum circuit. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To use this node, first select whether you wish to build a circuit with:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bits only</b> &#8594; qubits & classical bits</li>
      <li><b>Registers & Bits</b> &#8594; quantum & classical registers storing qubits and classical bits respectively</li>
    </ul>
    Registers are used to group bits with the same role together
    for circuit structuring purposes.
    <br /><br />
    Then, you must inform the number of:
    <ul>
      <li>Qubits & Classical bits in <b>Bits only</b> mode</li>
      <li>Quantum & Classical registers in <b>Registers</b> mode</li>
    </ul>
    This will define the number of outputs of the <i>Quantum Circuit</i> node. 
    <br/><br/>
    In fact, the node will generate and output:
    <ul>
      <li>Qubit objects in <b>Bits only</b> mode: to flow through the quantum gate nodes of the algorithm
      <li>Register objects in <b>Registers</b> mode: must be connected to <i>Quantum Register</i> & <i>Classical Register</i> nodes</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    By default, qubits are initialised in the '0 state'. <br/>
    To initialise the qubits in a specific state ('0' or '1'), you can pass a binary string in <code>msg.payload.binaryString</code> 
    to the <i>Quantum Circuit</i> node. The string must have a length equal to the total number of qubits in the circuit: 1 bit 
    initialises 1 qubit (e.g. '001101' for a 6 qubits circuit). <br />
    The first (visually higher) qubit will be set according to the first bit of the string, second higher qubit by the second bit, etc. 
    <br /><br />
    Classical bits, either in a register or as individual bits, are crucial in a quantum circuit to store the result of qubit measurements.

    <h5>Qubit State</h5>
    <p>
      A qubit is the same to a quantum computer than what a bit is to a classical computer: the smallest unit of information.
      <br /><br />
      <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html#statevectors"> Classical vs Quantum bits - Qiskit textbook</a>
      <br /><br />
      The <b>Bloch sphere</b> representation is considered as the most simple and ludic way to understand & visualise a qubit (see image below).
      <br /><br />
      In contrast with classical bits that can only be in a '0' or a '1' state, qubits can store much more information.
      In fact, all points on the sphere represent a different qubit state, the usual classical bit states being labelled as:
      <ul>
        <li>State 0</li>
        <li>State 1</li>
      </ul>
      Quantum states that are in between those 2 points are a weighted combination of the '0' and '1' states. This is called <b>superposition</b>. <br/>
      To set the qubit in a particular state, we operate rotations or reflections of the <b>Bloch sphere</b> while keeping the x, y and z axis unchanged.
      <br /><br />
      <b>Example:</b> Applying a &#960; radians rotation about the x-axis on a qubit that is in the '0 state' will put it in the '1 state'.

    <h5>Qubit Measurement</h5>
    <p>
      It is very important to understand that, even though a qubit can take an infinite number of states, our technology only allows us to measure '0' or '1', like on a classical bit.
      <br/><br/>
      Since we measure and interpret a qubit state using classical machines, this can be seen as a projection of quantum computing back to classical computing: from quantum states back to binary values.
      <br /><br />
      This leads to probabilistic measurement results.
      In terms of the <b>Bloch Sphere</b>, the closest the qubit state is from the '1 state', the more likely we are to measure a '1'.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Example:</b> If we measure a 1000 times a qubit that has a state in the x-y plane, then we will get more or less 500 '0' measurements and 500 '1' measurements. 
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Careful -</b> The act of measuring a qubit collapses the qubit state: the state of the qubit after being measured 
      is not representative of the qubit state before the measurement.<br/>
      Please measure the qubits at the end of the quantum circuit or reset them after a measurement.
