    <!-- Short (1 sentence) description of the node's objective for hovering effect -->
    This node applies Protfolio Optimisation Simulation with 1 of 3 different solver methods and custom parameters of user's choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <!-- In depth description of the node's features and how to use (node properties, node connections, ...) -->
  To use this node, the user must choose the solver, seeds, assets (qubits), start date and end date for the simulation. Each asset/stock is represented by a qubit.
  There are no other node from the quantum and quantum algorithm library are required to use this node.
