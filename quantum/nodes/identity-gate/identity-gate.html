    The identity gate corresponds to a null operation such as +0 or x1 in arithmetic.

  <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
      Qubit objects can be generated from:
      <ul>
        <li>'Quantum circuit' node in 'Bits only' mode.</li>
        <li>'Quantum register' node along with 'Quantum circuit' in 'Register & bits' mode.</li>
      </ul>

      Unless specified, qubits are initialised in the 0 state.

    <h5>Qubit State</h5>
    <p>
      A qubit is the same to a quantum computer than what a bit is to a classical computer: the smallest unit of information.<br />
      The <b>Bloch sphere</b> representation is considered as the most simple and ludic way to understand & visualise a qubit (see image below).
      <br /><br />
      In contrast with classical bits that can only be in a '0' or a '1' state, qubits can store much more information.
      In fact, all points on the sphere represent a different qubit state, the usual classical bit states being labelled as:
      <ul>
        <li>State 0</li>
        <li>State 1</li>
      </ul>
      To set the qubit in a particular state, we operate rotations or reflections of the <b>Bloch sphere</b> while keeping the x, y and z axis unchanged.
      <br /><br />
      <b>Example:</b> Applying a &#960; radians rotation about the x-axis on a qubit that is in the '0 state' will put it in the '1 state'.

    <h5>Qubit Measurement</h5>
    <p>
      It is very important to understand that, even though a qubit can take an infinite number of states, our technology only allows us to measure '0' or '1', like on a classical bit.
      <br/><br/>
      Since we measure and interpret a qubit state using classical machines, this can be seen as a projection of quantum computing back to classical computing: from quantum states back to binary values.
      <br /><br />
      This leads to probabilistic measurement results.
      In practice, the closest the qubit state is from the '1 state', the more likely we are to measure a '1'.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Example:</b> If we measure a 1000 times a qubit that has a state in the x-y plane, then we will get more or less 500 '0' measurements and 500 '1' measurements.
