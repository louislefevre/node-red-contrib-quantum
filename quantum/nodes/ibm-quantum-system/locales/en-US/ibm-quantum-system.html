      <!-- Node documentation goes here. -->
      This node is for running your quantum flow on an actual quantum computer via
      IBM Quantum. <br /><br />
      To use this node you must enter your API token for your IBM Quantum account
      and enter the quantum backend which you would like to use to run your
      quantum flow. <br /><br />
      By default, this node returns only the results of the quantum flow, but the
      'Verbose' output option can be selected to include information about the
      quantum machine it was run on, the job ID, etc.

      <p>
        Qubit objects can be generated from:
        <ul>
        <li><i>Quantum Circuit</i> node in 'Bits only' mode.</li>
        <li><i>Quantum Register</i> node along with <i>Quantum Circuit</i> in 'Register' mode.</li>
        </ul>
        Unless specified, qubits are initialised in the 0 state.
        <br /><br />

          For a brief summary of the main quantum computing concepts, please refer to the 
          <i>Details</i> section of the <i>Quantum Circuit</i> node.
