      <!-- Node documentation goes here. -->
      This node initialises the quantum circuit. <br /><br />
  
      To use this node, first select whether you wish to build a circuit with only
      bits or if you would like to include registers in the structure of your
      quantum circuit.<br /><br />
  
      Having done this, you must identify the number of quantum registers and
      classical registers you wish to include in your circuit, if you chose to use
      registers and bits, or choose the number of qubits and classical bits to
      include if you chose to design a circuit with only bits. <br /><br />
  
      Registers are used for grouping a number of bits of the same type together
      for circuit structuring purposes.<br /><br />
  
      Classical bits, either in a classical register or as individual bits, are
      needed to store the the values of qubits once they have been measured.
