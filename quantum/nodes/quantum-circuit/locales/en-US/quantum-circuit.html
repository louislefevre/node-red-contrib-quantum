      This node initialises the quantum circuit. <br /><br />
  
      To use this node, first select whether you wish to build a circuit with only
      bits or if you would like to include registers in the structure of your
      quantum circuit.<br /><br />
  
      Having done this, you must identify the number of quantum registers and
      classical registers you wish to include in your circuit, if you chose to use
      registers and bits, or choose the number of qubits and classical bits to
      include if you chose to design a circuit with only bits. <br /><br />
  
      Registers are used for grouping a number of bits of the same type together
      for circuit structuring purposes.<br /><br />
  
      Classical bits, either in a classical register or as individual bits, are
      needed to store the the values of qubits once they have been measured.

        <h5>Qubit State</h5>
        <p>
          A qubit is the same to a quantum computer than what a bit is to a classical computer: the smallest unit of information.

          <br /><br />
          The <b>Bloch sphere</b> representation is considered as the most simple and ludic way to understand & visualise a qubit (see image below).
          <br /><br />
          In contrast with classical bits that can only be in a '0' or a '1' state, qubits can store much more information.
          In fact, all points on the sphere represent a different qubit state, the usual classical bit states being labelled as:
          <ul>
            <li>State 0</li>
            <li>State 1</li>
          </ul>
          Quantum states that are in between those 2 points are a weighted combination of the '0' and '1' states. This is called <b>superposition</b>. <br/>
          To set the qubit in a particular state, we operate rotations or reflections of the <b>Bloch sphere</b> while keeping the x, y and z axis unchanged.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Example:</b> Applying a &#960; radians rotation about the x-axis on a qubit that is in the '0 state' will put it in the '1 state'.

        <h5>Qubit Measurement</h5>
        <p>
          It is very important to understand that, even though a qubit can take an infinite number of states, our technology only allows us to measure '0' or '1', like on a classical bit.
          <br/><br/>
          Since we measure and interpret a qubit state using classical machines, this can be seen as a projection of quantum computing back to classical computing: from quantum states back to binary values.
          <br /><br />
          This leads to probabilistic measurement results.
          In practice, the closest the qubit state is from the '1 state', the more likely we are to measure a '1'.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Example:</b> If we measure a 1000 times a qubit that has a state in the x-y plane, then we will get more or less 500 '0' measurements and 500 '1' measurements.
