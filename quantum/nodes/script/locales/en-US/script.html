      This node is not run until the preceeding node has finished executing. Note that this node is for debugging and
      development purposes, and is not suitable for production use in its current state. This is due to the fact that a
      user will not be able to generate the full script as execution will be triggered as the first qubit arrives, despite
      other qubits still having quantum gates to flow through.

        Qubit objects can be generated from:
        <ul>
        <li><i>Quantum Circuit</i> node in 'Bits only' mode.</li>
        <li><i>Quantum Register</i> node along with <i>Quantum Circuit</i> in 'Register' mode.</li>
        </ul>
        Unless specified, qubits are initialised in the 0 state.

          <i>Details</i> section of the <i>Quantum Circuit</i> node.
