    <p>
      This node measures the value of a qubit in order to convert the
      superpositioned qubit to a classical bit of value 0 or 1. <br /><br />
      To use this node you must have a classical bits initialised in the circuit
      then you must select the classical bit to which you wish to send the result
      of the measurement.
