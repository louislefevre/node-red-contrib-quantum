      <!-- Node documentation goes here. -->
      This node implements the toffoli gate. <br /><br />
      This node takes three input qubits (two controls and one target) and
      performs a not operation on the target node if and only if the two control
      qubits are in the state |1>. <br /><br />
  
      To use this node, you must indicate the position of the target qubit
      relative to the two control qubits.
