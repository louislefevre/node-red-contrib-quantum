    <p>
      This node can be used to control the order in which quantum gates are applied accross multiple qubits.
      It can also be used to visually differentiate qubits objects when they flow through the same wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrier will wait until a specified number of qubit objects have arrived to the node, before they are sent further
      along in the quantum circuit.
      <br/><br/>
      To do this, open the node properties and select the number of qubits objects
      that the barrier node will be expecting, before allowing them to continue running.

      <p>
          Qubit objects can be generated from:
          <ul>
          <li><i>Quantum Circuit</i> node in 'Bits only' mode.</li>
          <li><i>Quantum Register</i> node along with <i>Quantum Circuit</i> in 'Register' mode.</li>
          </ul>
  
          Unless specified, qubits are initialised in the 0 state.
