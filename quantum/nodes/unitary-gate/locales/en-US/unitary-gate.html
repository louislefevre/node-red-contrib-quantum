    <p>
      This node applies the unitary (U) quantum gate to the input qubit. 
      It is the most general single qubit gate and can apply any rotation and a phase shift.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do so, open the node properties and use the sliders to set the values
      of the 3 gate parameters:
      <ul>
        <li>Theta (&#952;): the rotation angle in radians along the y-axis</li>
        <li>Phi (&#966;): the rotation angle in radians along the z-axis</li>
        <li>Lambda (&#955;): the angle in radians for the phase shift</li>
      </ul> 
      In terms of the <b>Bloch Sphere</b> (see 'Details' below), this corresponds to rotations around
      the y and z-axis along with a phase shift.

    <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>
        Qubit objects can be generated from:
        <ul>
          <li>'Quantum circuit' node in 'Bits only' mode.</li>
          <li>'Quantum register' node along with 'Quantum circuit' in 'Register & bits' mode.</li>
        </ul>
  
        Unless specified, qubits are initialised in the 0 state.

      <h5>Qubit State</h5>
      <p>
        A qubit is the same to a quantum computer than what a bit is to a classical computer: the smallest unit of information.

        <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html#statevectors"> Classical vs Quantum bits - Qiskit textbook</a>
        <br /><br />
        The <b>Bloch sphere</b> representation is considered as the most simple and ludic way to understand & visualise a qubit (see image below).
        <br /><br />
        In contrast with classical bits that can only be in a '0' or a '1' state, qubits can store much more information.
        In fact, all points on the sphere represent a different qubit state, the usual classical bit states being labelled as:
        <ul>
          <li>State 0</li>
          <li>State 1</li>
        </ul>
        Quantum states that are in between those 2 points are a weighted combination of the '0' and '1' states. This is called <b>superposition</b>. <br/>
        To set the qubit in a particular state, we operate rotations or reflections of the <b>Bloch sphere</b> while keeping the x, y and z axis unchanged.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Example:</b> Applying a &#960; radians rotation about the x-axis on a qubit that is in the '0 state' will put it in the '1 state'.

      <h5>Qubit Measurement</h5>
      <p>
        It is very important to understand that, even though a qubit can take an infinite number of states, our technology only allows us to measure '0' or '1', like on a classical bit.
        <br/><br/>
        Since we measure and interpret a qubit state using classical machines, this can be seen as a projection of quantum computing back to classical computing: from quantum states back to binary values.
        <br /><br />
        This leads to probabilistic measurement results.
        In practice, the closest the qubit state is from the '1 state', the more likely we are to measure a '1'.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Example:</b> If we measure a 1000 times a qubit that has a state in the x-y plane, then we will get more or less 500 '0' measurements and 500 '1' measurements.
